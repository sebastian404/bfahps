# Big Fat Awesome House Party Server Reverse Engineered
All information in this document was determined by from playing the game and snooping network traffic and later altering returned values to observe the effect on the game.


## Server Architecture
The server was powered by Apache Tomcat serving both static and dynamic content.  Dynamic services were implemented using JavaServer Pages to provide backend services to the game.

Game assets where served from the `i.awesomehouseparty.com` domain, with assets used in the website severed initially from `i.cartoonnetwork.com` and later `i.cdn.turner.com` domains.

Game assets where located under the `/toonahp/` directory, while website assets where located under the `/toon/promos/200604_bfahp/tools/gamesite/` directory.

For a full list of assets see the [files.md](files.md) document.
